## Problem Description
- Binary Search:
  - Do the challenge problem first iteratively, then recursively.
  - Which approach do you prefer? Why? Reason with memory space vs time complexity vs readability.

- Breadth First Search:
  - Do the challenge problem iteratively, and then recursively.
  - Try your algorithm on a Tree. What output do you get?
